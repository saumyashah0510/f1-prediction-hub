    description: "In qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, Ayrton Senna drove a lap that transcended the sport. He outqualified his teammate Alain Prost—in the same car—by an incomprehensible 1.427 seconds. Senna later described this lap as an 'out-of-body experience' where he was driving on instinct alone, pushing beyond the physical limits of the car and the track. It remains arguably the greatest qualifying lap in F1 history."
